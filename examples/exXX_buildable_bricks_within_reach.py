# load brick network from saved json file
# create rfl robot and client
# set start state, iterate over brick placing frames and ask if reachable
# from all reachable, exclude those which are not buildable (network) with fixed linear axes
# and generate fabrication sequence
# iterate over sequence and generate paths
