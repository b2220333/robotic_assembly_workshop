# Workshop: Robotic Assembly with COMPAS framework

Materials for the Robotic Assembly workshop using COMPAS framework

> During this workshop, we will design an assembly of bricks, represented by a custom data structure, evaluate its stability and stability of the incomplete assembly at various stages of the assembly process, and plan the assembly process using a robotic arm.

## Requirements

* Operating System: the only Windows version that supports many of the requirements is **Windows 10** Pro.
* [Rhinoceros 3D 6.0](https://www.rhino3d.com/): Focus on will only on Rhino 6.0. [See here if you use Rhino 5.0](#rhino-50)
* [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/): 2.7 or 3.x
* [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/get-started): Download it for [Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) or [Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).
* X11 Server: On Windows use [XMing](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/), on Mac use [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (see details [here](https://medium.com/@mreichelt/how-to-show-x11-windows-within-docker-on-mac-50759f4b65cb)).
* Git: [official command-line client](https://git-scm.com/) or visual GUI (e.g. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/))
* [ABB RobotStudio](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio/downloads): 6.08 (only available for Windows). After install, **make sure you add RobotWare 6.03.02** (`Add-Ins` -> `RobotApps` -> `RobotWare` and add `6.03.02`). After completing the setup, you can open the [ABB Linear Axis station](robot_station) in RobotStudio.

> Note: if you get an error, scroll down to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Getting started

The very first thing to get started is to install **COMPAS** using Anaconda. Anaconda uses **environments** to create isolated spaces for projects' depedencies, it is recommendable that you do all the exercises in a newly created environment:

      conda create --name robotic-assembly-workshop python=3.6
      activate robotic-assembly-workshop

To install the main library and the packages we will use, start your Anaconda Prompt and run the following:

      conda config --add channels conda-forge
      conda install compas compas_fab

> **TODO**: Add here the setup for the other packages of the workshop (rbe & tna?)

Great! Now type `python` in your Anaconda Prompt (**run as administrator**), and test if the installation went well:

      >>> import compas
      >>> import compas_fab

If that doesn't fail, you're good to go! Exit the python interpreter (either typing `exit()` or pressing `CTRL+Z` followed by `Enter`).

Now let's make **compas** and **compas_fab** packages available inside Rhino. On the Anaconda Prompt, type the following:

      python -m compas_fab.rhino.install 6.0

Congrats! ðŸŽ‰ You are all set! Open Rhino and try to import compas to verify everything is working fine.

> **NOTE:**
> If the previous command throws an error, make sure you run the Anaconda Prompt as an **Administrator**.

## Setting up your development environment

You can use any development environment that you're comfortable with, but for this workshop, we suggest using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), since it provides very deep integration with Anaconda, debugging and many other niceties.

* Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and open it
* Go to `Extensions` and install:
  * `Python` (official extension)
  * `EditorConfig for VS Code` (optional -but recommended)
* On the bottom left status bar, select the python interpreter to use. The list will contain Anaconda environments, select the one created above: `robotic-assembly-workshop`.

As a starting point, download (or clone) the contents of the [`examples`](examples) folder and open it with VS Code (right-click the folder from Explorer -> `Open with Code`). Open `ex00_hello_compas.py` and press `F5` to run it.

## Let's get to work!

By now, you should be up and running and ready to start playing with the framework!

> Are you new to programming? Check out [this tutorial to learn some basics of Python and compas datastructures](https://compas-dev.github.io/main/tutorial/meshes.html)

### COMPAS concepts

> PLACEHOLDER: This section deals with basics of COMPAS: the ecosystem of backends & frontends, an overview of the main datastructures, an overview of algorithms, etc
> Include installation/setup and running a few snippets to check installation is correct.

### Python for COMPAS

> PLACEHOLDER: Explain some Python idioms and specifics applied or used in COMPAS, e.g. geometric key/maps, the use of callbacks, etc.

### Data Structures

> PLACEHOLDER: Explain COMPAS data structures, focus on Network as the rest of the workshop will work with that. Start working on an exercise to develop a custom data structure derived from `Network` in order to create an assembly.

### Assembly Design

> PLACEHOLDER: How to build an assembly based on COMPAS, how to identify interfaces, etc.

### Equilibrium

> PLACEHOLDER: Intro to compas_rbe, computing equilibrium, intermediate configurations, etc.

### Robotic fabrication

> PLACEHOLDER: Intro to compas_fab, robotics fundamentals (frame, transformation, kinematic chains), robot description models. Examples and exercises on fundamentals, and robot visualizations, FK, IK, etc.

### ROS Concepts

> PLACEHOLDER: Intro to ROS, main concepts (topics, actions, services, protocol), setup, distribution, etc. Execises on the very basics of ROS (Listener/Talker, basic interfacing, etc). Describe also Python concepts specific to dealing with ROS (async, etc).

### Path planning

> PLACEHOLDER: Setting up and path planning with ROS and MoveIt

### Assembly Process Simulation

> PLACEHOLDER: Integrate custom data structure for assembly with ROS tooling for path planning and simulate the assembly process entirely. Show simulated robot control (using either URSim or ABB Robot Studio).

## Rhino 5.0

The focus of the workshop will be on Rhino 6.0 only. While most things will work on Rhino 5.0, it is not recommended as there are several manual steps required to get the software to run.

However, if you do use Rhino 5.0, make sure to install the following:

 - [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/)
 - [GHPython](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython)
 - [IronPython 2.7.5](https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/releases/tag/ipy-2.7.5) ([see here for details about this manual update](https://compas-dev.github.io/main/environments/rhino.html#ironpython-1)).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes things don't go as expected. Here are some of answers to the most common issues you might bump into:

> Q: Docker does not start. It complains virtualization not enabled in BIOS.

This is vendor specific, depending on the manufacturer of your computer, there are different ways to fix this, but usually, pressing a key (usually `F2` for Lenovo) before Windows even start will take you to the BIOS of your machine. In there, you will find a `Virtualization` tab where this feature can be enabled.

> Q: Cannot start containers, nor do anything with Docker. Error message indicates docker daemon not accessible or no response.

Make sure docker is running. Especially after a fresh install, docker does not start immediately. Go to the start menu, and start `Docker for Windows`.

> Q: `conda` commands don't work.

Try running them from the *Conda Prompt*. Depending on how you installed Anaconda, it might not be available by default on the normal Windows command prompt.

> Q: When trying to install the framework in Rhino, it fails indicating the lib folder of IronPython does not exist.

Make sure you have opened Rhino 6 and Grasshopper at least once, so that it finishes setting up all its internal folder structure.

> Q: It fails when trying to install on Rhino.

Try running the command prompt as administrator. Depending on the version of Python, it might be required or not.

> Q: error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required

Follow the link to install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0
https://www.scivision.co/python-windows-visual-c++-14-required/

> Q: When running `conda install compas_fab`, I get the error: `cannot find Frame`

You have already installed an older, pre-release version of COMPAS. Please remove it.
